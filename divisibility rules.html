				<p>In this division, 3 is divided evenly into 6 to produce a whole number result (or quotient). A number is divisible by another number if the division produces a whole number.</p>
			<img src="images/face.jpg" class = "caled">
			<p>6 cannot be divided by 4 evenly because the division leaves a decimal answer. So, 6 is not divisible by 4.</p>
			<p>The same division— 6 ÷ 4 — can also be modeled with a remainder. Six can be divided into four parts equally with 2 remaining that can not be distributed equally. A number is not divisible if it leaves a remainder.</p>
		<p>
		In summary, a number  can be evenly divide by another number if the division results in a whole number quotient without a remainder. The number is said to “be divisible by” the divisor.
